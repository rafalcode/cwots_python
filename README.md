# cwots_python

these are (usually) simple python scripts whose purpose is demonstrate
the ways certain things can be done in this language.

# wlk2.py
captures all fastq.gz files in current directoryodoes some parsing on their names

# fqdprep.py
Copied walkf2.py over to fqdprep.py, which stands for Fastq Directory Preparation. The idea here is to take a directory of fastq paired reads
and create directories for each pair based on their prefix

# k2.py and derivatives
taken from the mertz book, particularly how goes about creating a class and what one can do with it.

#brna.py
simple operations in biopython.
