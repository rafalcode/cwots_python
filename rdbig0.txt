Reading big files in python

Let's say you want line count cheaply

Michael Bacon soln using a generator based on chunks

def _make_gen(reader):
    b = reader(1024 * 1024)
    while b:
        yield b
        b = reader(1024*1024)

def rawpycount(filename):
    f = open(filename, 'rb')
    f_gen = _make_gen(f.raw.read) # f i the file handle
    return sum( buf.count(b'\n') for buf in f_gen )

this is quite an interesting one , in one line actually

num_lines = sum(1 for line in open('myfile.txt'))
