Python's SQLAlchemy and Object-Relational Mapping

   A common task when programming any web service is the construction of a
   solid database backend. In the past, programmers would write raw SQL
   statements, pass them to the database engine and parse the returned
   results as a normal array of records. Nowadays, programmers can write
   Object-relational mapping (ORM) programs to remove the necessity of
   writing tedious and error-prone raw SQL statements that are inflexible
   and hard-to-maintain.

   ORM is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible
   type systems in object-oriented programming languages. Usually, the
   type system used in an OO language such as Python contains types that
   are non-scalar, namely that those types cannot be expressed as
   primitive types such as integers and strings. For example, a Person
   object may have a list of Address objects and a list of PhoneNumber
   objects associated with it. In turn, an Address object may have a
   PostCode object, a StreetName object and a StreetNumber object
   associated with it. Although simple objects such as PostCodes and
   StreetNames can be expressed as strings, a complex object such as a
   Address and a Person cannot be expressed using only strings or
   integers. In addition, these complex objects may also include instance
   or class methods that cannot be expressed using a type at all.

   In order to deal with the complexity of managing objects, people
   developed a new class of systems called ORM. Our previous example can
   be expressed as an ORM system with a Person class, a Address class and
   a PhoneNumber class, where each class maps to a table in the underlying
   database. Instead of writing tedious database interfacing code
   yourself, an ORM takes care of these issues for you while you can focus
   on programming the logics of the system.

The Old Way of Writing Database Code in Python

   We're going to use the library sqlite3 to create a simple database with
   two tables Person and Address in the following design:

   SQLAlchemy Person and Address DDL

   Note: If you want to checkout how to use SQLite for Python, you might
   want to have a look at the [27]SQLite in Python series.

   In this design, we have two tables person and address and
   address.person_id is a foreign key to the person table. Now we write
   the corresponding database initialization code in a file sqlite_ex.py.

   24
     import sqlite3
     conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

     c = conn.cursor()
     c.execute('''
               CREATE TABLE person
               (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ASC, name varchar(250) NOT NULL)
               ''')
     c.execute('''
               CREATE TABLE address
               (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ASC, street_name varchar(250),
     street_number varchar(250),
                post_code varchar(250) NOT NULL, person_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                FOREIGN KEY(person_id) REFERENCES person(id))
               ''')

     c.execute('''
               INSERT INTO person VALUES(1, 'pythoncentral')
               ''')
     c.execute('''
               INSERT INTO address VALUES(1, 'python road', '1', '00000', 1)
               ''')

     conn.commit()
     conn.close()

   Notice that we have inserted one record into each table. Run the
   following command in your shell.

   1
    $ python sqlite_ex.py

   Now we can query the database example.db to fetch the records. Write
   the following code in a file sqlite_q.py.

    import sqlite3

    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute('SELECT * FROM person')
    print c.fetchall()
    c.execute('SELECT * FROM address')
    print c.fetchall()
    conn.close()

   And run the following statement in your shell.

   1
   2
   3
    $ python sqlite_q.py
    [(1, u'pythoncentral')]
    [(1, u'python road', u'1', u'00000', 1)]

   In the previous example, we used an sqlite3 connection to commit the
   changes to the database and a sqlite3 cursor to execute raw SQL
   statements to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) data in the
   database. Although the raw SQL certainly gets the job done, it is not
   easy to maintain these statements. In the next section, we're going to
   use SQLAlchemy's declarative to map the Person and Address tables into
   Python classes.

Python's SQLAlchemy and Declarative

   There are three most important components in writing SQLAlchemy code:
     * A Table that represents a table in a database.
     * A mapper that maps a Python class to a table in a database.
     * A class object that defines how a database record maps to a normal
       Python object.

   Instead of having to write code for Table, mapper and the class object
   at different places, SQLAlchemy's declarative allows a Table, a mapper
   and a class object to be defined at once in one class definition.

   The following declarative definitions specify the same tables defined
   in sqlite_ex.py:

     import os
     import sys
     from sqlalchemy import Column, ForeignKey, Integer, String
     from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
     from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
     from sqlalchemy import create_engine

     Base = declarative_base()

     class Person(Base):
         __tablename__ = 'person'
         # Here we define columns for the table person
         # Notice that each column is also a normal Python instance
     attribute.
         id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
         name = Column(String(250), nullable=False)

     class Address(Base):
         __tablename__ = 'address'
         # Here we define columns for the table address.
         # Notice that each column is also a normal Python instance
     attribute.
         id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
         street_name = Column(String(250))
         street_number = Column(String(250))
         post_code = Column(String(250), nullable=False)
         person_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('person.id'))
         person = relationship(Person)

     # Create an engine that stores data in the local directory's
     # sqlalchemy_example.db file.
     engine = create_engine('sqlite:///sqlalchemy_example.db')

     # Create all tables in the engine. This is equivalent to "Create Table"
     # statements in raw SQL.
     Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

   Save the previous code into a file sqlalchemy_declarative.py and run
   the following command in your shell:

   1
    $ python sqlalchemy_declarative.py

   Now a new sqlite3 db file called "sqlalchemy_example.db" should be
   created in your current directory. Since the sqlalchemy db is empty
   right now, let's write some code to insert records into the database:

     from sqlalchemy import create_engine
     from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

     from sqlalchemy_declarative import Address, Base, Person

     engine = create_engine('sqlite:///sqlalchemy_example.db')
     # Bind the engine to the metadata of the Base class so that the
     # declaratives can be accessed through a DBSession instance
     Base.metadata.bind = engine

     DBSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
     # A DBSession() instance establishes all conversations with the
     database
     # and represents a "staging zone" for all the objects loaded into the
     # database session object. Any change made against the objects in the
     # session won't be persisted into the database until you call
     # session.commit(). If you're not happy about the changes, you can
     # revert all of them back to the last commit by calling
     # session.rollback()
     session = DBSession()

     # Insert a Person in the person table
     new_person = Person(name='new person')
     session.add(new_person)
     session.commit()

     # Insert an Address in the address table
     new_address = Address(post_code='00000', person=new_person)
     session.add(new_address)
     session.commit()

   Save the previous code into a local file sqlalchemy_insert.py and run
   the command python sqlalchemy_insert.py in your shell. Now we have one
   Person object and one Address object stored in the database. Let's
   query the database using the classes defined in
   sqlalchemy_declarative.py:

     >>>
     >>> # Retrieve one Address whose person field is point to the person
     object
     >>> session.query(Address).filter(Address.person == person).one()
     <sqlalchemy_declarative.Address object at 0x2ee3cd0>
     >>> address = session.query(Address).filter(Address.person ==
     person).one()
     >>> address.post_code

Summary of Python's SQLAlchemy

   In this article, we learned how to write database code using
   SQLAlchemy's declaratives. Compared to writing the traditional raw SQL
   statements using sqlite3, SQLAlchemy's code is more object-oriented and
   easier to read and maintain. In addition, we can easily create, read,
   update and delete SQLAlchemy objects like they're normal Python
   objects.

   You might be wondering that if SQLAlchemy's just a thin layer of
   abstraction above the raw SQL statements, then it's not very impressive
   and you might prefer to writing raw SQL statements instead. In the
   following articles of this series, we're going to investigate various
   aspects of SQLAlchemy and compare it against raw SQL statements when
   they're both used to implement the same functionalities. I believe at
   the end of this series, you will be convinced that SQLAlchemy is
   superior to writing raw SQL statements.

       I am a bit confused and stuck with errors.
       I have created the database using the above example with class
       Review and table names business_id and useful.
       class Review(Base):
       __tablename__ = `rev'
       business_id = Column(String(50), primary_key=True)
       useful = Column(Integer,nullable=False)
       the database is created perfectly but when i m using the below code
       for inserting records. I get a lot of errors..Please help
       session = DBSession()
       new_rating=Review(useful=4)
       session.add(new_rating)

       I'm stuck... Need help
       So I downloaded the SQLAlchemy program, and have been using the
       python shell 3.4.1
       I also downloaded the Oracle VM and Vagrant so to start learning a
       specific course but I've not been able to properly implement the
       SQLAlchemy module. I peform the : import sqlalchemy ... and "from
       sqlalchemy import column....etc" and shows an error still... I
       can'd understand where the issue is. Any comments?
